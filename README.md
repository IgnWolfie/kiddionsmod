# Kiddions Mod Menu - External Menu for GTA 5, FiveM & RDR2

Welcome to the official repository for **Kiddions Mod Menu**, a powerful and user-friendly **external mod menu** for **Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5)**, **FiveM**, and **Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2)**. This tool enhances your gameplay experience by enabling a variety of customizable features without injecting directly into the game's process.

Kiddions Mod Menu is a free, external mod menu designed primarily for GTA 5, but it also supports FiveM and RDR2 to some extent.
